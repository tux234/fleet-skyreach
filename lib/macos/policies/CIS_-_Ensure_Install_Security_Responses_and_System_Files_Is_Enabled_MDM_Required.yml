    Ensure that system and security updates are installed after they are available from
    Apple. This setting enables definition updates for XProtect and Gatekeeper. With this
    setting in place, new malware and adware that Apple has added to the list of malware or
    untrusted software will not execute.
  resolution: Ask your system administrator to deploy an MDM profile that enables automatic critical system and security updates.
