  description: A locking screen saver is one of the standard security controls to limit access to a computer and the current user's session when the computer is temporarily unused or unattended. In macOS, the screen saver starts after a value is selected in the drop- down menu. 20 minutes or less is an acceptable value. Any value can be selected through the command line or script, but a number that is not reflected in the GUI can be problematic. 20 minutes is the default for new accounts.
