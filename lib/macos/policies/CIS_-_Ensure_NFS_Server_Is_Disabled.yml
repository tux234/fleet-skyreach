  description: |
    MacOS can act as an NFS fileserver. NFS sharing could be enabled to allow someone on another computer to mount
    shares and gain access to information from the user's computer.
  resolution: |
    Automated method:
    Ask your system administrator to deploy the following script which will disable the NFS service
    and its directory listing:
    /usr/bin/sudo /bin/launchctl disable system/com.apple.nfsd
    /usr/bin/sudo /bin/rm /etc/exports
  platform: darwin
